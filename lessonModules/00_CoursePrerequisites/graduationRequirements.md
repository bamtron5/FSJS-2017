One of the first things that we want you to know is that we WANT you to be a very, very successful programmer.  It's in our best interests for a successful camp, but more than that, we really enjoy seeing our campers succeed.  The track record so far is that every troop is getting a little better than the one before and we are always striving to make the curriculum better so that you have a higher chance of success.

That said, you can fail to graduate camp and we want to be explicit about what it takes to graduate so that you know exactly what we are looking at.  If you don't graduate, then you don't get a certificate and you don't get the benefit of being introduced to hiring partners, you will not be able to use us as a reference on your resume, and we cannot bring you back for alumni events later.  Obviously, it's very important for these reasons, but you also need a sense of completion and success before starting your career, so take these requirements seriously.

Here are our graduation requirements:
You must complete all phases of camp. We offer our campers options, no matter what their experience level is when they come to camp.  The first phase takes place in the first 6 weeks and then group project phase is the last 6 weeks.  There's also an optional Masters Program to allow you more time dedicated to building projects and practicing your new skills.  

You must show up on time and on scheduled camp days. This seems obvious, but you cannot become nocturnal during the middle of camp.   Regular camp hours are 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday and you must be there during those minimum hours.   We recommend that you are at camp on evenings and weekends as well.

You must be a helpful, active participant in the group project that must also meet the group project requirements. A big part of camp is learning to work on a team.  If you do not contribute to your troop's group project, you will not have effectively learned to work on a team. We will look at your check-ins and speak with other team members about your contributions.

You must complete an individual project that also meets the given requirements. At the end of the day, we have to know that you can get the job done. There was a lot of material covered before coming to camp and we want to have a comprehensive project completed by the end of camp that you can call your own.  The good news is that you should start this project as early in the camp experience as possible, working on key components and adding features as you learn them.

You must complete the Resume Building and Interview Prep exercises. We can help you learn all the coding skills in the world, but if you don't learn how to interview, it's not going to do you a bit of good.  These exercises are as important to your success as the coding exercises.

You must complete the Week 5 Live Exam. At the end of the fifth week of camp, you will be presented with a coding challenge. If you cannot complete the coding challenge then you cannot graduate.
